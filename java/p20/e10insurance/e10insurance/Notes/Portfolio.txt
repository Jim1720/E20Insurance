	round 1 .. 

 10 ( n/a ) round 1 reg - looks good - dup check ok. changed name edits back to name1 for cust id and password and consistency.
    (ok)x update - do not save password but copy from existing data if not entered; if any entered edits!
                 reason: user may change mind so need to actively key the data
    (ok)x claim - hi lite buttons - remove b1 
    (works passed)  reg/upd test server down turn off e20.
    (do not think this is an issue!  )  note: token errors after restarting 20 for 'server down' issues.
    (works)  reg.claim.update teste date flips; reg/upd - look ok. 
         claim token error - claim screen date works ok on edit
    (fixed)X claim - 'last clinic' error message when climic mIssing 'last' should not appear in message.
    note: we tested adj different claim types before and combo box filled ok with default or updated type on adj
    (fixed)x menu: adjustment message is scruntched need to move message field to left
    (PASS ) menu - remember - need to access menu via redirects so messages can be cleared. ex update edit msg not cleared if customer
               goes to menu. // DECIDED NOT TO DO THIS FOR NOW....
    (fixed )x claim - changing dropdown (claim page . js) has an 'alert'. 

   -- back up to R01.
    
   
   June 8 E10 status: round 1 fixes in progress 
   (TOTALLY FIXED) 1 functional - address 2 , mid name will not allow blanks. 
   (works)x center message on menu; added offset-md-2 to class.
   (works) menu message suppress (MMS) - redirect to show/clear message . 
   (x )x remove trail comma in edit messages reg,clm,upd. 
   (Looks good) 2  date clean up
          - reg,update, claim - added commas after date messages ; added the specific date field to editBean message so
            we know which date and finally kept keyed date on screen when error occurs.
          (good) reg, update, claim (3)
   (ALL IS WORKIGN ON ADM) adm
       (works) password reset
       (works) customer reset
       (fixed) -- putting bad credentials gets a 404 / check for 404 and say 'invalid creds'.
       (fixed)-- any edits completely blank screen should not blank it
       (fixed) new cust ne confirm
   ( )? non matching type fields not blue on adjustment entry screen / ?
   ( )? 2 pay - bad amt empty history screen. // claimpage.js does a return but data lost - not sure why
   (n/a) claim count not used on update ; correct on history screen!
   (ok ) chrome and ie tests ;  same bugs as edge with adj hilite type fields missing for other types no color issues;
         same pay issue bad amt clears hist screen! no issues here.
   ( ) check data consistency on records with e10 and a40 to insure formatting 
   ( ) read up on azure migration to production.

   Qualifies as R02! praise the LORD!
