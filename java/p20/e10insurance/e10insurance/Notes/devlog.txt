 5.12 - drop downs - remove pb34 then research reg, update.
 5.12 - added pass,config recall to reg screen : last keyed
 5.12 - added id=Styler to container so that claimpagejs can look for id=Styler.
 5.12 - claimpage.js - added id=Stylerlookup to activate color features.
 5.12 - fullmenu - add verbiage including color style notes.

 5.12 - StyleReset - Settings screen, StyleController, will be used to clear then
        style list for all screens, and to a non-screen redirect to appriporiate 
        controller.  atypical since links do not go to controllers as we found out
        in the admin codings but this case the redirect will send to a real screen.

 5.12   Center Picture
        screens: update, claim
        action: added a div above style to center the style; so div order is 
        container, center styles, style, form on the update and claim screens.
        style elements when used
        changed name to id and code in claimpage.js to look for the id.
        used th:addclass coding to put extra 'centerstyle' class in the html.


 5.12   password edit = e20 add code to check for customer existence
        added editflag and message similar to reset customer pojo.
        tune response check code to look for flag and mesage in the client.
        
        ** added constructor to resetPassword and resetCustomer to 
        ** include flag, message on return entity to caller.

 5.12   token - design requirment
        read up on redis spring boot and 
        jwt spring boot an plan coding changes
        for all post, puts. 
        again, you will need 2 customer reads: register-read, and customer-existience-read    
        as the register-read passes back a jwt token.

5.12    concerned about chnges to CDNs. can we use them in production?

5.12   adjust offset colors  

5.12    any other issues listed in history?

 ====

     that simple !!
5.13 password reset works.
5.13 customer reset fails - NewCustomer is null.

5.15 adm actions working

5.17 added jwt to pom.

       	<dependency>
			<groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
			<artifactId>jjwt</artifactId>
			<version>0.9.1</version>
		</dependency>
 5.17 - 
       a. signin - gets token and stores in session bean
       b. reg    - gets token and stores in session bean
       * java lompnbec * set,get fyi ** 

 5.18 - a. changed admin signin to go to e20 for env.admin id and env.password
        b. e20 - added token logic without expiration only check secret to validate request at this point.
        c. may add cust id to the token to seem more authentic !
        d. add expiration time to the token.
        e. storage note: reddis is used to hold server storage with jedis, lettuce etc.
           will attempt to use a bean with scope of singleton
           that should last the application context lifecycle
           to hold the expiring records for jwt verifications.
           'baeldung' bean life cycles.
 
  5.18 environment variable change:
       a. admin id and password now read by e20 environment
       b. e20 environment has a 'secret' variable for the json web token.

  5.18 fit finish : claim screen; line up confine/rel cf a40 that's lined up.

  5.18 claim - moved form to match a40; no change
  5.18 claim - added div after the id='am' wow. this is it! all lined up.

  5.21 colors - added message color variables 
  5.21 styles - need to make screen consistent sizes
  5.21 token  - working on token logic getting expired error.
  5.21 logging e20 added logging to start and token validation 
  5.21 env vars - had to pass from controller bean would not accept them directly.
  
  5.22 timeout - made this a parm to controllers to pass to create token
  5.22 update controller - fixed wrong coding here; should read token from header NOT passed data!
  5.22 verified the token logic basically worked but env timeout broke it temporarily
  5.22 passed admind and custid to 'someid' in the token routine.

  5.27 - adm - fixed http entities to send dummy string and return string 
  5.27 - customer list is now working
  5.27 - styles / margin-left : claimpage.js : supplied margin-left's to keep screens centered when           
         using colors. adding widths to bg- classes to not squeeze form in these cases.
         moved msg to right of buttons ; have controller 1 set message to reduce
         message coding commented out; do same for claim screen.
         
  5.28   PASSED - admin action  pw reset cust reset - with tokens test.
  5.28   FIXED - was putting NULL into the customer object on 1st update - removed that stmt.
  5.28   FIXED - internal plan field not updated when plan changes - was updating parm not cust obj.
                 wrong coding 'autowire'  planparm custobj.!
  5.28   TESTED - token time out and bypass ok.
  5.28   FIXED - update edit maligns date upon edit;  
  5.28   FIXED - bad date format ; was putting bean in the screen attribute when update edit!
  5.28   UPDATE - removed lower level try and controller catches error but
                  wrong error message shows up 'bad req'.
  5.28   update - date vanishes when edit happens - replace date with entered value please.

  5.28   update catcher = code plan=null and try update : top try catch should work with message....
  5.28   put update changes to claim screen for sizing...
  5.28   solid transition of 2s working just fine.
  
  5.28  fixed percent logic to trim/match; added update to field totalcharge on claim.

  6.5 - added . space to name1 edit criteria
