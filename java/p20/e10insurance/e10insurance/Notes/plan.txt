  ( ) 10 - fix signin; fix edits on update screen; build clm, pln, hist screens.
           repositoy pattern is implied on the server api side basd on domain functions eg adj claim etc.
           ( ) admin incomplete needs env, to check pw,adm id. 

    10.5 pass data as JSON and if needed use data mapper on server side to get to entity classes.
         what conventions/restrictions on field names?

        BLOCK 1 - register, signin in -> read (reg), read-token (signin), add-token (register)       
                  read promo, email-list from env autowired
                  check cors to see any issues
                  csrf bealdung - meta pages plus add hdr if use json!
                       any other way
                  csrf ref with thymleaf:
                    https://www.baeldung.com/csrf-thymeleaf-with-spring-security
                  ** test CSRF article is confusing but
                     suggests 'enabled' by default.
                  ** authentication in article is done by app already.
                     do we need spring security ??

       BLOCK 2 - medical claim only -  claim history
   
       BLOCK 3 - CLAIM TYPES SCREEN history

       BLOCK 4 - PLAN AND CALC COVERAGES

       Block 4a - token but csrf above suggests enabled by default !
                  jwttoken and redis used if azure supports
                  redis at low or no cost.

       BLOCK 5 - ADMIN
